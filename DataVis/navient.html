		<p style="font-family:'Uchen', serif;">Navient Solutions, LLC, a student loan servicer, has come under fire in several lawsuits since 2017, including a suit from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Many consumers feel they have been misled by the corporation (https://www.studentloanplanner.com/navient-lawsuit-updates/).</p>

<p style="font-family:'Uchen', serif;">The data compiled show the difference in the amount of complaints towards Navient Solutions, LLC and overall consumer complaints by U.S. region, over one year (11/9/20 to 11/9/21). As expected, the number of Navient complaints over the year was much lower than the overall number of complaints. While there were over 483,450 overall complaints, there were 31,542 complaints about Navient Solutions, LLC (https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/consumer-complaints/search/?dataNormalization=None&dateRange=3y&date_received_max=2021-11-09&date_received_min=2018-11-09&searchField=all&searchText=Navient%20Solutions%2C%20LLC&tab=Map).</p>

<p style="font-family:'Uchen', serif;">The data in both charts look somewhat similar. However, a higher percentage of complaints specifically towards Navient came from the Northeast when compared to the percentage of overall complaints from the Northeast. The Midwest and West both make up slightly smaller percentages in complaints towards Navient as opposed to overall complaints. The South, similarly in both graphs, has filed the greatest number of both Navient and overall complaints by far. </p>
