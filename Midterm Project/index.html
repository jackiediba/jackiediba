<p><strong>PAJU, South Korea —</strong>In a new Korean drama being filmed inside a cavernous 
studio building outside of Seoul, a detective chases down a man cursed to 
live for 600 years. Pistol shots crack. A hush follows. Then, a woman 
pierces the silence, screaming: “I told you not to shoot him in the 
heart!”</p>

<p>
The scene was filmed several times for more than an hour as part of 
“Bulgasal: Immortal Souls,” a new show scheduled to be released on Netflix 
in December. Jang Young-woo, the director, hopes it will be the latest 
South Korean phenomenon to captivate an international audience.

South Korea has long chafed at its lack of groundbreaking cultural 
exports. For decades the country’s reputation was defined by its cars and 
cellphones from companies like Hyundai and LG, while its movies, TV shows 
and music were mostly consumed by a regional audience. Now K-pop stars 
like Blackpink, the dystopian drama “Squid Game” and award-winning films 
such as “Parasite” appear as ubiquitous as any Samsung smartphone.
</p>
<p>
In the same way South Korea borrowed from Japan and the United States to 
develop its manufacturing prowess, the country’s directors and producers 
say they have been studying Hollywood and other entertainment hubs for 
years, adopting and refining formulas by adding distinctly Korean touches. 
Once streaming services like Netflix tore down geographical barriers, the 
creators say, the country transformed from a consumer of Western culture 
into an entertainment juggernaut and major cultural exporter in its own 
right.
</p>

<div class="large-6 medium-6 small-6 cell box2">
<p>In the last few years alone, South Korea shocked the world with 
“Parasite,” the first foreign language film to win best picture at the 
Academy Awards. It has one of the biggest, if not the biggest, band in the 
world with BTS. Netflix has introduced 80 Korean movies and TV shows in 
the last few years, far more than it had imagined when it started its 
service in South Korea in 2016, according to the company. Three of the 10 
most popular TV shows on Netflix as of Monday were South Korean.</p>

<p>“When we made ‘Mr. Sunshine,’ ‘Crash Landing on You’ and ‘Sweet Home,’ we 
didn’t have a global reaction in mind,” said Mr. Jang, who worked as co-
producer or co-director on all three hit Korean Netflix shows. “We just 
tried to make them as interesting and meaningful as possible. It’s the 
world that has started understanding and identifying with the emotional 
experiences we have been creating all along.”</p>

<p>The growing demand for Korean entertainment has inspired independent 
creators like Seo Jea-won, who wrote the script for “Bulgasal” with his 
wife. Mr. Seo said his generation devoured American TV hits like “The Six 
Million Dollar Man” and “Miami Vice,” learning “the basics” and 
experimenting with the form by adding Korean colors. “When over-the-top 
streaming services like Netflix arrived with a revolution in distributing 
TV shows, we were ready to compete,” he said.</p>

<p>South Korea’s cultural output is still tiny compared with key exports like 
semiconductors, but it has given the country the sort of influence that 
can be hard to measure. In September, the Oxford English Dictionary added 
26 new words of Korean origin, including “hallyu,” or Korean wave. North 
Korea has called the K-pop invasion a “vicious cancer.” China has 
suspended dozens of K-pop fan accounts on social media for their 
“unhealthy” behavior.</p>

<p>The country’s ability to punch above its weight as a cultural powerhouse 
contrasts with Beijing’s ineffective state-led campaigns to achieve the 
same kind of sway. South Korean officials who have attempted to censor the 
country’s artists have not been very successful. Instead, politicians have 
begun promoting South Korean pop culture, enacting a law to allow some 
male pop artists to postpone conscription. This month, officials allowed 
Netflix to install a giant “Squid Game” statue in Seoul’s Olympic Park.</p>

<p>

<div class="large-6 medium-6 small-6 cell box5">
<p>The explosive success didn’t happen overnight. Long before “Squid Game” 
became the most watched TV show on Netflix or BTS performed at the United 
Nations, Korean TV shows like “Winter Sonata” and bands like Bigbang and 
Girls’ Generation had conquered markets in Asia and beyond. But they were 
unable to achieve the global reach associated with the current wave. Psy’s 
“Gangnam Style” was a one-hit wonder.</p>

<p>“We love to tell stories and have good stories to tell,” said Kim Young-
kyu, CEO of Studio Dragon, South Korea’s largest studio, which makes 
dozens of TV shows a year. “But our domestic market is too small, too 
crowded. We needed to go global.”</p>

<p>It wasn’t until last year when “Parasite,” a film highlighting the yawning 
gap between rich and poor, won the Oscar that international audiences 
truly began to pay attention, even though South Korea had been producing 
similar work for years.</p>

<p>“The world just didn’t know about them until streaming platforms like 
Netflix and YouTube helped it discover them at a time when people watch 
more entertainment online,” said Kang Yu-jung, a professor at Kangnam 
University, in Seoul.</p>

<p>Before Netflix, a select number of national broadcasters controlled South 
Korea’s television industry. Those broadcasters have since been eclipsed 
by streaming platforms and independent studios like Studio Dragon, which 
provide the financing and artistic freedom needed to target international 
markets.</p>

<p>South Korean censors screen media for content deemed violent or sexually 
explicit, but Netflix shows are subject to less stringent restrictions 
than those broadcast on local TV networks. Creators also say that domestic 
censorship laws have forced them to dig deeper into their imagination, 
crafting characters and plots that are much more compelling than most.</p>

<p>Scenes often overflow with emotionally rich interactions, or “sinpa.” Heroes are usually deeply flawed, ordinary people trapped in impossible situations, clinging to shared values such as love, family and caring for others. Directors and producers say they deliberately want all of their characters to “smell like humans.”</p>

<p>As South Korea emerged from the vortex of war, dictatorship, 
democratization and rapid economic growth, its creators developed a keen 
nose for what people wanted to watch and hear, and it often had to do with 
social change. Most national blockbusters have story lines based on issues 
that speak to common people, such as income inequality and the despair and 
class conflict it has spawned.</p>

<p>“Squid Game” director Hwang Dong-hyuk first made a name for himself with 
“Dogani,” a 2011 movie based on a real-life sexual abuse scandal in a 
school for the hearing-impaired. The widespread anger the film incited 
forced the government to ferret out teachers who had records of sexual 
abuse from schools for disabled minors.</p>

<p>Although K-pop artists rarely speak about politics, their music has loomed 
large in South Korea’s lively protest culture. When students in Ewha 
Womans University in Seoul started campus rallies that led to a nationwide 
anti-government uprising in 2016, they sang Girls’ Generation’s “Into the 
New World.” The boy band g.o.d.’s “One Candle” became an unofficial anthem 
for the “Candlelight Revolution” that toppled President Park Geun-hye.</p>

<p>“One dominating feature of Korean content is its combativeness,” said Lim 
Myeong-mook, author of a book about Korean youth culture. “It channels the 
people’s frustrated desire for upward mobility, their anger and their 
motivation for mass activism.” And with many people now stuck at home 
trying to manage the enormous angst caused by the pandemic, global 
audiences may be more receptive to those themes than ever before.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;">
  “The takeaway is: what sells in 
South Korea sells globally.” - Mr. Jang</h1>

<p>“Korean creators are adept at quickly copying what’s interesting from 
abroad and making it their own by making it more interesting and better,” 
said Lee Hark-joon, a professor of Kyungil University who co-authored “K-pop Idols.”</p>

<p>On the set of “Bulgasal,” dozens of staffers scurried around to get every 
detail of the scene just right — the smog filling the air, the water drops 
falling on the damp floor and the “sad and pitiable” look of the gunned-
down man. The show’s supernatural plot recalls American TV favorites like 
“X-Files” and “Stranger Things,” yet Mr. Jang has created a uniquely 
Korean tragedy centered on “eopbo,” a belief among Koreans that both good 
and bad deeds affect a person in the afterlife.</p>

<p>Based on the recent success of Korean shows abroad, Mr. Jang said he hopes 
viewers will flock to the new series. “The takeaway is: what sells in 
South Korea sells globally.”</p>
